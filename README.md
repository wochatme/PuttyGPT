# PuttyGPT = Putty + ChatGPT

Today is the Artificial Intelligence(AI) era. AI will change the world fundamentally. Putty is one of the most popular SSH tools in the world. PuttyGPT is yet another Putty with AI enabled. PuttyGPT is based on the codebase of Putty, and provides the ability for you to talk to AI during your work. PuttyGPT is also open-sourced and free for basic AI chat service.

You can see the below screenshot to easily understand its usage.

You can use PuttyGPT to connect to a server such as Linux or FreeBSD box, just like what you do with Putty. But PuttyGPT has a robot chat window showing as well. During your operation in Putty window, you can ask any question when you want or your have some technical problem. The AI chat robot will read the output of your Putty window and try to understand your problem, and provide professional answer to help you fix your trouble.

## How Does PuttyGPT Work?

The idea behind PuttyGPT is very simple, just like the picture showed in the below:

When you use PuttyGPT to connect to your server, a robot chat window will also be created. This robot chat window will connect to https://www.wochat.ai/v1 by using HTTPS protocol. When you want to seek help, you can ask the questions in the robot chat window. PuttyGPT will send the below information to wochat.ai:
1. your question.
2. the output of your Putty window. (can be disabled by parameter of special command)

If you care about the sensitivity of the output of your PuttyGPT window and do not want to send it to AI, you can set "screen = 0" in the configuration file conf.json, or use "--" as the first 2 characters of your question, just like the comment of SQL code.

If you are a student to learn some IT technology such as Linux administration, or play with PostgreSQL/MySQL or any software in Linux, you may not care about the sensitivity of the output of your lab server. What you want to do is to get some professional suggestion or help somewhere, then PuttyGPT is a very very good assistant during your study journey.

After your question and the output of your Putty window are sent to wochat.ai, we have a professional knowledge base focus on Linux/PostgreSQL/MySQL, etc. The server will search relative data in the knowlege base and send your question to some famous general LLM(large language model) such as ChatGPT or Claude.  So the information sent to ChatGPT/Claude include:

1. your question.
2. the output of your Putty window.
3. the knowledge found in the knowledge base.
4. more professional prompts generated by a special LLM on wochat.ai.

When ChatGPT or Claude gets the above information, it will generate more professional answer, especially dedicated to your question and trouble. This is the key value of PuttyGPT: what you get from wochat.ai is more professional than the answer you get from the general LLM such as ChatGPT or Claude. 

Please try PuttyGPT, and compare the answer of PuttyGPT with the answer you ask ChatGPT directly. You will find the difference. And we hope PuttyGPT will help you better than ChatGPT on the focused area such Linux/PostgreSQL/MySQL adminstration.

PuttyGTP is always open-sourced and free for the basic chating service.

## How To Use PuttyGPT?

If you are familar with Putty, then you have little issue to learn how to use PuttyGPT. It is just another Putty, but with AI chating ablility.

When it is the first time for PuttyGPT to run, it will check if there is a configuration file called conf.json in the same directory. If it cannot find this file, putty.exe will generate a conf.json file filled with the default parameters. The below is the default content of conf.json:

```
{
"key" : "03339A1C8FDB6AFF46845E49D120E0400021E161B6341858585C2E25CA3D9C01CA",
"url" : "https://www.wochat.ai/v1",
"font0" : "Courier New",
"font1" : "Courier New",
"fsize0" : 11,
"fsize1" : 11,
"startchat" : 1,
"screen" : 1,
"autologging" : 1,
"proxy_type" : 0,
"proxy" : ""
}
```

You can modify the values of the parameters and restart PuttyGPT to make your change to be effective.

In the above parameter steetings, the most important thing is the "key". wochat.ai will use this key value to identify the user. The default key is a free-for-ever key you can use. Or you can go to https://www.wochat.ai to register a new account and generate a new key to get more professional service.

Let me explain the meaning of these parameters:
- key : a 66-byte long string only contains 0-9 and A-Z. The backend server will use this key to identify the authorized user.
- url : this is the interface where PuttyGPT will send the request to. Usually you do not need to change it.
- font0 : the font name of the chat window. This is the upper window in the robot chat window. You can change it to another font name such as "Arial", etc.
- font1 : the font name of the input window. This is the lower window in the robot chat window where you can input your question.
- fsize0 : the font size for font0. 11 is a good default value. But you can enlarge it to 13 or 36 to try to get the best size you like.
- fsize1 : the font size for font1.
- startchat : if this parameter is 0, the robot chat window will not pop up when you start PuttyGPT. Non-zero value means the robot chat window will pop out when you connect to your server. 
- autologging: if this parameter is non-zero, PuttyGPT will save all the chat history into the log files like log_xxxx.txt. xxxx is the process Id of your PuttyGPT. Where this parameter is 0, PuttyGPT will not record your chat history.

If you connect to the internet by using some proxy, you need to configure the below two parameters:
- proxy_type : The value is from 0 to 8. Zero means no proxy. This is the common case. The value 1 to 8 represent different proxy type that libCurl supports.
- proxy : if proxy_type is non-zero, we will use this parameter to configure your proxy settings. 

For better understanding for proxy settings, please check the below link as a good start point:

https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE.html

The proxy_type values is:
- 0 : no proxy
- 1 : CURLPROXY_HTTP
- 2 : CURLPROXY_HTTP_1_0
- 3 : CURLPROXY_HTTPS
- 4 : CURLPROXY_HTTPS2
- 5 : CURLPROXY_SOCKS4
- 6 : CURLPROXY_SOCKS5
- 7 : CURLPROXY_SOCKS4A
- 8 : CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME

For each proxy type, you need to specify the values of "proxy". The value of "proxy" is the null-terminated string holding the hostname or dotted numerical IP address. Please check https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html for the detailed meaning for different proxy settings.

## How To Download PuttyGPT?

PUttyGPT is a tiny execution file like "puttygpt-0.8.1.exe" with size less than 2MB. That's all your need. You can download PuttyGPT from Release page:

https://github.com/wochatme/PuttyGPT/releases

Maybe Windows will report there is virus in this exe file, please ignore it. We will make signature of PuttyGPT in the future to avoid this issue.

Maybe you do not trust the pre-compiled program we provided, then you can compile PuttyGPT directly from the source code. PuttyGPT is 100% open sourced. Please read the next section about how to build PuttyGPT from the source code.
