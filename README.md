# PuttyGPT = Putty + ChatGPT

Today is the Artificial Intelligence(AI) era. AI will change the world fundamentally. Putty is one of the most popular SSH tools in the world. PuttyGPT is yet another Putty with AI enabled. PuttyGPT is based on the codebase of Putty, and provides the ability for you to talk to AI during your work. PuttyGPT is also open-sourced and free for basic AI chat service.

You can see the below screenshot to easily understand its usage.

You can use PuttyGPT to connect to a server such as Linux or FreeBSD box, just like what you do with Putty. But PuttyGPT has a robot chat window showing as well. During your operation in Putty window, you can ask any question when you want or your have some technical problem. The AI chat robot will read the output of your Putty window and try to understand your problem, and provide professional answer to help you fix your trouble.

## How Does PuttyGPT Work?

The idea behind PuttyGPT is very simple, just like the picture showed in the below:

When you use PuttyGPT to connect to your server, a robot chat window will also be created. This robot chat window will connect to https://www.wochat.ai/v1 by using HTTPS protocol. When you want to seek help, you can ask the questions in the robot chat window. PuttyGPT will send the below information to wochat.ai:
1. your question.
2. the output of your Putty window. (can be disabled by parameter of special command)

If you care about the sensitivity of the output of your PuttyGPT window and do not want to send it to AI, you can set "screen = 0" in the configuration file conf.json, or use "--" as the first 2 characters of your question, just like the comment of SQL code.

If you are a student to learn some IT technology such as Linux administration, or play with PostgreSQL/MySQL or any software in Linux, you may not care about the sensitivity of the output of your lab server. What you want to do is to get some professional suggestion or help somewhere, then PuttyGPT is a very very good assistant during your study journey.

After your question and the output of your Putty window are sent to wochat.ai, we have a professional knowledge base focus on Linux/PostgreSQL/MySQL, etc. The server will search relative data in the knowlege base and send your question to some famous general LLM(large language model) such as ChatGPT or Claude.  So the information sent to ChatGPT/Claude include:

1. your question.
2. the output of your Putty window.
3. the knowledge found in the knowledge base.
4. more professional prompts generated by a special LLM on wochat.ai.

When ChatGPT or Claude gets the above information, it will generate more professional answer, especially dedicated to your question and trouble. This is the key value of PuttyGPT: what you get from wochat.ai is more professional than the answer you get from the general LLM such as ChatGPT or Claude. 

Please try PuttyGPT, and compare the answer of PuttyGPT with the answer you ask ChatGPT directly. You will find the difference. And we hope PuttyGPT will help you better than ChatGPT on the focused area such Linux/PostgreSQL/MySQL adminstration.

PuttyGTP is always open-sourced and free for the basic chating service.
